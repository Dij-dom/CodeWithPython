    "\n",
    "This document explains core performance concepts commonly tested in\n",
    "Data Scientist / Software Engineer interviews.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Short Answer\n",
    "**Average case: O(1)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation (Conceptual)\n",
    "Python dictionaries use a **hash table** internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you access:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "value = d[key]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python:\n",
    "1. Computes a hash for `key`\n",
    "2. Uses the hash to jump directly to a memory location\n",
    "3. Retrieves the value without scanning other keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this direct access, dictionary lookup is **constant time on average**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Note\n",
    "- Worst case can degrade to O(n) due to hash collisions\n",
    "- In practice, Python’s hashing strategy makes this extremely rare\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interview-ready takeaway\n",
    "> Dictionary lookups are fast because hashing allows direct access instead of searching.\n",

    "## 2. Why is set lookup faster than list lookup?\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "### Set Lookup (What happens internally)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x in my_set\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python hashes the value and jumps directly to the correct location.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Analogy\n",
    "- **List** → searching a name in an unsorted notebook\n",
    "- **Set** → looking up a contact by phone number\n",

    "### Optimized Version\n",

    "```python\n",
    "set2 = set(list2)\n",

    "    if a in set2:\n",

    "❌ Nested loop approach:\n",

    "for i in range(len(arr)):\n",
    "    for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):\n",
    "        if arr[i] == arr[j]:\n",
    "            print(arr[i])\n",

    "```python\n",

    "for x in arr:\n",
    "    if x in seen:\n",

    "## Key Mental Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you see:\n",
    "- Nested loops\n",
    "- Repeated `in` checks\n",
    "- Comparisons against large collections\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask yourself:\n",
    "> “Can I replace this with a hash-based lookup?”\n",

    "\n",
    "## One-Page Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dictionary lookup:** O(1) average due to hashing\n",
    "- **Set vs List:** Set is faster because it avoids scanning\n",
    "- **Nested loop optimization:** Replace inner loops with hash lookups\n",
    "- **Trade-off:** Slightly more memory for major speed improvement\n",

    "- Your reasoning\n",
    "- Your ability to recognize inefficiencies\n",
    "- Your choice of the right data structure"
